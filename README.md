# MileStoneProjectDGB

I wanted to make some sort of racing car game and the initial thought that came to mind was a high speed car chase.
I watched tons of tutorials on youtube about many diffrent javascript games and use a mixture of many diffrent ones in order to create mines 
Wanted to give credits to KnifeCircus on youtube as many of his videos helped me and was even the foundation of my game 

Main goal of the game

- run away from police
- avoid and weave through police
- set a highscore of miles traveled without being caught/crashing
- car should/will be moving forward at all times

Controls Arrow Keys/WSAD Keys

- Left Arrow moves car left
- Right Arrow moves car right
